# Teraurge-map-editor

a map editor for the game called [Teraurge](https://teraurge.blogspot.com)

works with Teraurge version 2.13

built in [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.12.1 tkinter

## dependencies

python [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

## notes
### custom color picker is experimental use at your own risk
the dots are called blips

about 2000 blips on screen at once and it starts to get framey

to many on screen at once and python might throw a error or just freeze

I've have had up to 20600 and it makes the program barely usable
